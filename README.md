In order to understand git, we must first understand the basic functions and definitions of it.

Git Definitions

GIT--a form of supply chain management software and a distributed system that allows collaboration on code without the need for a network connection  

GITHUB—a web-based, GIT hosting service that provides access control and collaboration tools in a GUI interface 

Repository—a project’s “folder” where all project contents are held

Clone—does exactly that; creates a clone of the respective repository

Commit—code fixes that are pushed to the main when approved

Push—uploads local repo content to a remote repo 

Pull—fetches and downloads git content then immediately updates the local repo to math 

Branch—a “folder” that stores commits; organizational structure to point towards different commits

Merge—merges a user’s commit(s) to the respective branch

Merge Conflict—when a user’s commits or merge interfere with the current branch; usually caused by an outdated master branch

Fetch—same as pull but does not automatically update the local repo

Remote—allows changes to be pulled from a remote repo, branch, etc and immediately applies those changes to the respective branch

First and foremost, Git is how programmers share and collaborate on code and is integral in the work force for all things tech related. Being unfamiliar with Git says to your possible future employer that you do not care about the technological advancements over the course of the last two decades.
